  abstract = {Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a well established method for data-driven tuning of linear controllers. In VRFT the design is performed in ``one-shot'', that is, with only one batch of input-output data, without the need of iterative data collection procedures. Its core concept consists in treating input-output data collected from the plant to be controlled as if they had been obtained from a virtual experiment, in which a particular reference signal - the virtual reference - would have been applied to the closed-loop system. A key feature of the VRFT method is that it greatly simplifies the design procedure with respect to standard model reference design: for linear and linearly parametrized controllers, it results in convexification of the design, so that its solution can be found by a single least squares method. In this paper this paradigm is applied to the tuning of nonlinear controllers. We propose specific design procedures for two classes of nonlinear plants: rational plants and plants of the Wiener type. Statistical properties of the controllers thus designed in noisy environments are also illustrated.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with two problems: the identification and compensation of hysteresis nonlinearity in dynamical systems using nonlinear polynomial autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX). First, based on gray-box identification techniques, some constraints on the structure and parameters of NARX models are proposed to ensure that the identified models display a key feature of hysteresis. In addition, a more general framework is developed to explain how hysteresis occurs in such models. Second, two strategies to design hysteresis compensators are presented. In one strategy, the compensation law is obtained through simple algebraic manipulations performed on the identified models. In the second strategy, the compensation law is directly identified from the data. Both numerical and experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed procedures. Also, it has been found that the compensators based on gray-box models outperform the cases with models identified using black-box techniques.},

  abstract = {A discrete-time backstepping controller with an active disturbance attenuation property for the Inverted-Pendulum system is constructed in this paper. The main purpose of this study is to show that Immersion and Invariance (I \& I) approach can be used to design a nonlinear observer for disturbance estimation and demonstrate its effectiveness considering a nonlinear system with an unstable equilibrium point, namely InvertedPendulum system, by utilizing the estimated values in backstepping control design. All designs are directly performed in discrete-time domain to obtain directly implementable observer and controller in discrete processors with superior performance compared to emulators. The InvertedPendulum system is not in strict feedback form therefore backstepping procedure cannot be directly applied. In order to enable backstepping construction, firstly a partial feedback linearization is performed and afterwards a novel discrete-time coordinate transformation is proposed. Prior to the construction of partial feedback linearizing and backstepping controller, a nonlinear disturbance estimator design is proposed with Immersion and Invariance approach. The estimated disturbance values used in the partial feedback linearization and construction of the backstepping controller. The global asymptotic stability of the estimator and local asymptotic stability of overall closed loop system are proved in the sense of Lyapunov. Performance of proposed direct discrete-time backstepping control with discrete I \& I observer is compared with a backstepping sliding mode controller with another nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) by simulations.},

Improvement in model global stability was achieved by using simple a priori information that takes into account the steady-state voltage relation of the converter.

Simulated examples which include polynomial, rational and neural network models are discussed. Our results\textemdash obtained using different model classes\textemdash show that, in general the use of simulation error is preferable to prediction error.

HDP(\&\#x03BB;) learns from more than one future reward. Eligibility traces have long been popular in Q-learning. This paper proves and demonstrates that they are worthwhile to use with HDP. In this paper, we prove its uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) property under certain conditions. Previous works present a UUB proof for traditional HDP [HDP(\&\#x03BB;=0)], but we extend the proof with the \&\#x03BB; parameter. By using Lyapunov stability, we demonstrate the boundedness of the estimated error for the critic and actor neural networks as well as learning rate parameters. Three case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HDP(\&\#x03BB;). The trajectories of the internal reinforcement signal nonlinear system are considered as the first case. We compare the results with the performance of HDP and traditional temporal difference [TD(\&\#x03BB;)] with different \&\#x03BB; values. The second case study is a single-link inverted pendulum. We investigate the performance of the inverted pendulum by comparing HDP(\&\#x03BB;) with regular HDP, with different levels of noise. The third case study is a 3-D maze navigation benchmark, which is compared with state action reward state action, Q(\&\#x03BB;), HDP, and HDP(\&\#x03BB;). All these simulation results illustrate that HDP(\&\#x03BB;) has a competitive performance; thus this contribution is not only UUB but also useful in comparison with traditional HDP.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the choice of regressors in non-linear polynomial models. Because the starting point is a tentative model, the procedure can be interpreted as a model structure simplification scheme. Given a tentative model y(k | k \textendash{} 1) estimated from a set of data Z, it is shown how simple analytical manipulations yield a corresponding two-step-ahead polynomial ya(k + 1 | k \textendash{} 1). On the other hand, using the data Z and classical structure selection algorithms it is possible to choose the structure of a data-driven two-step-ahead polynomial y(k + 1 | k \textendash{} 1). The common terms in ya(k + 1 | k \textendash{} 1) and y(k + 1 | k \textendash{} 1) are called self-consistent. If the tentative model has any terms that produce non-self-consistent terms in ya(k + 1 | k \textendash{} 1), such terms should be removed. The new procedure was tested on simulated and measured data in cases where the classical structure selection algorithms selected spurious terms. Results show that using self-consistency, one is able to detect such spurious terms.},

Building on the authors' previous work in identification and control of the software systems, the approach utilises frequency sampling filter structure to describe the linear dynamics and B-spline curve functions for the inverse static output nonlinearity. Furthermore, the issue on parameter selection for B-spline model approximation of scatter data is addressed by using a data clustering method. An experimental test-bed of virtualised software system is established to generate real observational data which are used to confirm the performance of the proposed approach. The identification results have shown that the model efficacy is increased with the proposed approach because the dimension of the nonlinear model can be significantly reduced while maintaining the desired accuracy.},

Some of them are reduced unit cost and size, ruggedness, brushless (in squirrel cage construction), absence of separate dc source, ease of maintenance, self-protection against severe overloads and short circuits, etc. In isolated systems, squirrel cage induction generators with capacitor excitation, known as self-excited induction generators (SEIGs), are very popular.

The converter compensates the current harmonics, the reactive power and the load unbalances at its AC side and dissipates the active power excess through the chopper at its DC side. The designed control architecture assures that, in steady state, the rms values of the voltages and the frequency remain at the their reference values.

  abstract = {Data-driven methodologies have recently emerged as an important paradigm alternative to model-based controller design and several such methodologies are formulated as an H2 performance optimization. This book presents a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the H2 approach to data-driven control design. The fundamental properties implied by the H2 problem formulation are analyzed in detail, so that common features to all solutions are identified.

  abstract = {Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a well established method for data-driven tuning of linear controllers. In VRFT the design is performed in "one-shot", that is, with only one batch of input-output data, without the need of iterative data collection procedures. Its core concept consists in treating input-output data collected from the plant to be controlled as if they had been obtained from a virtual experiment, in which a particular reference signal - the virtual reference - would have been applied to the closed-loop system. A key feature of the VRFT method is that it greatly simplifies the design procedure with respect to standard model reference design: for linear and linearly parametrized controllers, it results in convexification of the design, so that its solution can be found by a single least squares method. In this paper this paradigm is applied to the tuning of nonlinear controllers. We propose specific design procedures for two classes of nonlinear plants: rational plants and plants of the Wiener type. Statistical properties of the controllers thus designed in noisy environments are also illustrated.},

  abstract = {An online adaptive reinforcement learning-based solution is developed for the infinite-horizon optimal control problem for continuous-time uncertain nonlinear systems. A novel actor-critic-identifier (ACI) is proposed to approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation using three neural network (NN) structures - actor and critic NNs approximate the optimal control and the optimal value function, respectively, and a robust dynamic neural network identifier asymptotically approximates the uncertain system dynamics. An advantage of using the ACI architecture is that learning by the actor, critic, and identifier is continuous and simultaneous, without requiring knowledge of system drift dynamics. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed using Lyapunov-based adaptive control methods. A persistence of excitation condition is required to guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the actor-critic-identifier method for approximate optimal control. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The robot is capable of passive roll and pitch stabilization against small disturbances while actively stabilizing the yaw and the altitude. We achieve omnidirectional horizontal motion by shifting the center of gravity. The structure is made out of lightweight polyurethane and carbon fiber. Preliminary tests show that "CoaX" is able to hover for short moments and the lateral control is effective. \textcopyright{} 2006 IEEE.},

The VRFT tuning scheme is accommodated for two controller structures: the first one which explicitly includes a model of the DZ inverse to be identified and the second one which uses a Neural Network (NN) to model the controller to be identified. The main question to be answered here is whether if the inclusion of an explicit model of a static nonlinearity (DZ in this case) can be avoided while preserving the control system performance. Thorough investigation case studies are carried out both in simulation and experiment on a laboratory 3D-crane system as a typical servo system control application.},

Our focus is on the generation of the major cell type of the human liver, the hepatocyte. Current protocols produce variable populations of hepatocytes that are the product of using undefined components in the differentiation process. This serves as a significant barrier to scale-up and application. To tackle this issue, we designed a defined differentiation process using recombinant laminin substrates to provide instruction. We demonstrate efficient hepatocyte specification, cell organization, and significant improvements in cell function and phenotype. This is driven in part by the suppression of unfavorable gene regulatory networks that control cell proliferation and migration, pluripotent stem cell self-renewal, and fibroblast and colon specification. We believe that this represents a significant advance, moving stem cell-based hepatocytes closer toward biomedical application.},

It is shown by the identifiability analysis that only three out of the eight model parameters can be identified with the available measurements and that identification of the remaining parameters would require further knowledge of the initial conditions. A prediction error algorithm is implemented for the estimation of the identifiable parameters.

Because the method originates from embedding the control design problem in the Prediction Error identification of an optimal controller, it is baptized as Optimal Controller Identification (OCI). Incorporating different levels of prior information about the optimal controller leads to different design choices, which allows to shape the bias and variance errors in its estimation. It is shown that the limit case where all available prior information is incorporated is tantamount to model-based design. Thus, this methodology also provides a framework in which model-based design and DD design can be fairly and objectively compared. This comparison reveals that DD design essentially outperforms model-based design by providing better bias shaping, except in the full order controller case, in which there is no bias and model-based design provides smaller variance. The practical effectiveness of the design methodology is illustrated with experimental results.},

This is a very serious problem for data-based control design methods, where the plant is typically unknown. In this paper, we extend the Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning method to non-minimum phase plants. This extension is based on the idea proposed in Lecchini and Gevers (2002) for Iterative Feedback Tuning. We present a simple two-step procedure that can cope with the situation where the unknown plant may or may not have non-minimum phase zeros.},

  abstract = {Piezoelectric actuators have been widely employed in various nanopositioning systems. Hysteresis exhibited by piezoelectric actuators can degrade their behavior, and thus the tracking performance of positioning systems. To improve the performance of the systems, control of hysteresis has been drawing considerable attention. One of the issues that remain to be addressed in the controller design is how to deal with the constraints (e.g., the input voltage) that might be applied to the piezoelectric actuators. To avoid overloading the piezoelectric actuators, the mechanism of saturation is typically employed in control schemes, which, however, can degrade the control performance. This paper presents the development of an inversion-based model predictive control with an integral-of-error state variable to compensate for the piezoelectric-actuator hysteresis. The proposed method allows for the consideration of constraints in the controller design. Theoretical proof of the zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection properties of the proposed method is also provided. To verify the effectiveness of the control method, experiments were conducted with the results showing that the proposed method can improve the performance of piezoelectric actuators. \textcopyright{} 1996-2012 IEEE.},

Satellite ACS design usually based on computer simulations without experimental verification can face instability and/or inefficient controller performance due to model uncertainties. In this paper one investigates the robustness and performance of the time domain approach LQG (Lineal Quadratic Gaussian) and the frequency domain H\textendash Infinity approach. The satellite ACS design is performed initially in a computer simulation environment, following experimentally verification of the same control algorithm, using Quanser rotary flexible link module. This investigation has shown that the controller performance based on simulation model can be degraded when applied in an experimental set up. So this prototype verification is fundamental before satellite onboard computer algorithms implementation. 1},

Through a computer model of this simulator is programmed a proportional control law given by the Linear Quadratic Regulator theory, considering noise in the process and in the measurements are present. Then, with Kalman filter theory, the position and the angular velocity are estimated and the advantages and/or disadvantages about the use of only one position sensor for all states estimation against the use of one sensor for the angular position and another for angular velocity. Finally the performance of the filter feeding the controller with the estimated states instead of their actual values is evaluated, which is what occurs in practice.},

AIC is justified in a very general framework, and as a result, offers a crude estimator of the expected discrepancy: one which exhibits a potentially high degree of negative bias in small-sample applications (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989). AICc corrects for this bias, but is less broadly applicable than AIC since its justification depends upon the form of the candidate model (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989, 1993; Hurvich et al., 1990; Bedrick and Tsai, 1994). Although AIC and AICc share the same objective, the derivations of the criteria proceed along very different lines, making it difficult to reconcile how AICc improves upon the approximations leading to AIC. To address this issue, we present a derivation which unifies the justifications of AIC and AICc in the linear regression framework.},

Although existing analytical hysteresis models such as the generalized Bouc-Wen (BW) model and the Bouc-Wen-Baber-Noori (BWBN) model can be used to model the hysteretic behaviour of passive control systems, the generalized BW model fails to account the pinching or stiffness degradation of hysteretic systems and the BWBN model requires to tune considerable parameters before its application. Therefore, we propose this alternative approach to predict the hysteresis response of passive control systems. The NARX model is the branch of artificial intelligence which is a promising tool for the forecasting of time series problems. We adopted the NARX model to predict the hysteretic behaviour with experimental results conducted on yielding shear panel device (YSPD) and steel slit damper (SSD), respectively. A good agreement between the experimental results on both YSPD and SSD and the prediction results was achieved. We also combined the NARX model and the general regression neural network (GRNN) as a hybrid model to predict hysteretic behaviour of the SSD of which the damper design was hidden from the model training process. The performance of using the hybrid model to predict the hysteretic behaviour of SSD is reasonably well. Finally, the applicability of the hybrid model has been successfully demonstrated through the optimisation of the geometrical parameters of the SSD. We concluded that the proposed NARX model is capable to predict the hysteretic behaviour of passive control systems.},

A nonlinear diffeomorphism is introduced to explore the system structure and a simple filter is presented to `transform' the sensor fault into a pseudo-actuator fault scenario. A sliding mode observer is designed to reconstruct the sensor fault precisely if the system does not experience any uncertainty, and to estimate the sensor fault when uncertainty exists. The reconstruction and estimation signals are based only on available information and thus can be implemented online. Finally, a mass\textendash spring system is used to illustrate the approach.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multi-stage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are nearly optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a non-linear moving average model with exogenous inputs (NMAX) and a non-linear auto-regressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) respectively to model static and dynamic hysteresis inherent in piezoelectric actuators. The modeling approach is based on the expanded input space that transforms the multi-valued mapping of hysteresis into a one-to-one mapping. In the expanded input space, a simple hysteretic operator is proposed to be used as one of the coordinates to specify the moving feature of hysteresis. Both the modified Akaike's information criterion (MAIC) and the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm are employed to estimate the appropriate orders and coefficients of the models. The advantage of the proposed approach is in the systematic design procedure which can on-line update the model parameters so as to accommodate to the change of operation environment compared with the classical Preisach model. Moreover, the obtained model is non-linear in variables but linear in parameters so that it can avoid the problem of sticking in local minima which the neural network based models usually have. The results of the experiments have shown that the proposed models can accurately describe static and dynamic behavior of hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2014 IEEE. In this paper, a nonlinear auto-regressive moving average model with exogenous inputs(NARMAX) based pseudo-Hammerstein model is proposed for the identification of rate-dependent hysteresis. The presented model has the cascade structure comprised of a NARMAX model in series with an auto-regressive moving average(ARMA) model. In view of the multivalued mapping of hysteresis, a hysteretic operator is introduced to establish an expanded input space for the NARMAX model where the change tendency of the rate-dependent hysteresis can be extracted. To avoid the tedious dynamic back-propagation optimization for the auto-regressive(AR) parameters of the NARMAX model within the pseudo-Hammerstein model, a NARMAX model with the introduced hysteretic operator is applied to implement a preliminary identification for the rate-dependent hysteresis. Both the modified Akaike information criterion (MAIC) and the recursive least squaresfRLS) algorithm are employed to estimate an appropriate structure and the AR parameters of the NARMAX model. Subsequently, the Levenberg-Ma-rquardt(L-M) algorithm of the pseudo-Hammerstein model is developed to acquire an appropriate structure and the parameters of the ARMA model as well as the remaining parameters of the NARMAX model. Finally, numerical simulation results on a Duhem model of the piezoelectric actuators have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The switching of the current that circulates for the inductor, in intervals of larger or smaller times, according to the reactive power need, it is made using control techniques. The control technique to be used is fuzzy logical or diffuse logic. The efficiency of the control system will be observed starting from the self-excitation of the generator, where settles down the permanent regime of voltage in emptiness. In this point the load will be varied in the terminals of the generator, being observed the control of the voltage in its terminals. The whole control system is made keeping constant the speed of the generator. For the control system simulation a mathematical model is used, developed in variables "abc", that includes the magnetic saturation in induction machines with specific application for the self-excited induction generator [Resende, JT, 1999], [Bispo, D., et al., November-December 2001]. It will also be made simulations with the control technique P(I)D for performance comparison techniques, with the objective of checking so the efficiency of the control fuzzy technique as its similarity with controller PD.},

  abstract = {A technique that provides closed loop integral action depending on the passive outputs of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems is already available. This paper addresses a new method that allows us to add integral action also on system variables having relative degree higher than one, while still preserving the Hamiltonian form and, thus, closed loop stability. The new approach is applied to design speed regulation controllers for the permanent magnet synchronous motor. Closed loop stability and asymptotic rejection of unknown piecewise constant load torques are formally proved. This theoretically predicted control system performance is illustrated via simulation experiments, which also show that the properties hold under parameter uncertainties. This is in line with the usual practice of including integral action in a controller with the aim of improving its closed loop robustness. The fact that the method enhances the range of possible integral actions in the controller, enriched with this robustness property, allows us to assess it as a practically important complement to the well-known interconnection and damping assignment techniques developed in the framework of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A controller exists if and only if the unique stabilizing solutions to two algebraic Riccati equations are positive definite and the spectral radius of their product is less than {$\gamma$} 2. Under these conditions, a parametrization of all controllers solving the problem is given as a linear fractional transformation (LFT) on a contractive, stable free parameter. The state dimension of the coefficient matrix for the LFT, constructed using these same two Riccati solutions, equals that of the plant, and has a separation structure reminiscent of classical LQG (i.e., 3C2) theory.

  abstract = {Partly motivated by the nanopositioning application in AFM and SPM systems, we consider the problem of tracking periodic signals for a class of systems consisting of linear dynamics preceded by a hysteresis operator, where uncertainties exist in both the dynamics and the hysteresis. A servocompensator is proposed, in combination with an approximate hysteresis inverse, to achieve high-precision tracking. The servocompensator accommodates the internal model of the reference signal and a finite number of harmonic terms. It is shown that, with a Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operator, the closed-loop system admits a unique, asymptotically stable, periodic solution, which justifies treating the inversion error as an exogenous periodic disturbance. Consequently, the asymptotic tracking error can be made arbitrarily small when the servocompensator accommodates a sufficient number of harmonic terms. Robustness with respect to uncertainties in the dynamics is also established. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the approach and evaluate the role of hysteresis inversion. In particular, experiments on a nanopositioner show that, with the proposed method, tracking can be achieved for a 200 Hz reference signal with 0.6\% mean error and 2.3\% peak error for a travel range of 20 \&amp;\#x03BC;m.},

The Model Structure Selection (MSS) turns out to be the hardest task of the identification process due to the difficulty of correctly evaluating the importance of a generic term. As a result, classical MSS methods sometimes yield unsatisfactory models, that are unreliable over long-range prediction horizons. The MSS problem is here recast into a probabilistic framework based on which a randomized algorithm for MSS is derived, denoted RaMSS. The method introduces a tentative probability distribution over models and progressively updates it by extracting useful information on the importance of each term from sampled model structures. The proposed method is validated over models with different characteristics by means of Monte Carlo simulations, which show its advantages over classical and competitor probabilistic MSS methods in terms of both reliability and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {In many control applications, it is attractive to describe nonlinear (NL) and time-varying (TV) plants by linear parameter-varying (LPV) models and design controllers based on such representations to regulate the behavior of the system. The LPV system class offers the representation of NL and TV phenomena as a linear dynamic relationship between input and output signals, which is dependent on some measurable signals, e.g., operating conditions, often called as scheduling variables. For such models, powerful control synthesis tools are available, but the way how to systematically convert available first principles models to LPV descriptions of the plant, to efficiently identify LPV models for control from data and to understand how modeling errors affect the control performance are still subject of undergoing research. Therefore, it is attractive to synthesize the controller directly from data without the need of modeling the plant and addressing the underlying difficulties. Hence, in this paper, a novel data-driven synthesis scheme is proposed in a stochastic framework to provide a practically applicable solution for synthesizing LPV controllers directly from data. Both the cases of fixed order controller tuning and controller structure learning are discussed and two different design approaches are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is also illustrated by means of an academic example and a real application based simulation case study.},

The main strategy adopted in this paper is to construct an error system, which describes the dynamics of the tracking error, by a passive port-controlled Hamiltonian system. After obtaining the error system, tracking control of the original system can be achieved by stabilizing the error system via passivity-based approach. First, a fundamental framework is provided for constructing the error system via generalized canonical transformations. Then a concrete design procedure is derived for a class of electro-mechanical systems. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a magnetic levitation system and laboratory experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The MIMO systems consist of interconnected subsystems, with couplings in the forms of unknown nonlinearities and/or parametric uncertainties in the input matrices, as well as in the system interconnections without any bounding restrictions. Using the block-triangular structure properties, the stability analyses of the closed-loop MIMO systems are shown in a nested iterative manner for all the states. By exploiting the special properties of the affine terms of the two classes of MIMO systems, the developed neural control schemes avoid the controller singularity problem completely without using projection algorithms. Semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) of all the signals in the closed-loop of MIMO nonlinear systems is achieved. The outputs of the systems are proven to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectories. The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters. The proposed schemes offer systematic design procedures for the control of the two classes of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the approach.},

This paper presents a computer-based tracking control approach for a piezoceramic actuator based on incorporating a feedforward loop with a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) feedback controller. The hysteresis nonlinearity of the piezoceramic actuator is modeled in the feedforward loop by using the classical Preisach model. Experiments were performed on a stacked piezoceramic actuator for tracking sinusoidal waveforms with signal frequencies ranging from 0.1-20 Hz. A comparison was made between a feedforward control scheme, a regular PID feedback control scheme, and a PID feedback control scheme with hysteresis modeling in the feedforward loop. The results show that the tracking control performance is greatly improved by augmenting the feedback loop with a model of hysteresis in the feedforward loop. The maximum error in tracking a sinusoidal waveform is about half that obtained using a regular PID controller},

My old method involved moving all of my dotfiles into their own directory and then symlinking each one of them back into the directory structure.  What a headache! Using git bare repositories, there is no more moving files into an initialized git repository and then creating symlinks.  Now, I just add, commit and then push.  Done. Want to make your own git bare repository?  First, make a directory for your new git bare repository (I created one called "dotfiles" but you can name it whatever). Then I entered the following in the terminal: git init --bare \$HOME/dotfiles alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=\$HOME/dotfiles/ --work-tree=\$HOME' (add this alias to .bashrc) bash config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no Basic usage example: config add /path/to/file config commit -m "A short message" config push WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE GIT BARE REPO? By using the git bare repo, you can have nested git repos in your home directory and there will not be any issue with keeping things straight.   That is the reason for the git bare repo and having an alias ("config"). ARTICLE REFERENCED IN THE VIDEO: 📖 https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/... 💰 WANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL?

This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements.},

  abstract = {Equations of motion are derived for systems of rotationally interconnected bodies in which the terminal bodies may be flexible and the remaining bodies are rigid. The bodies may have an arbitrary `topological tree' arrangement; that is, there are no closed loops of bodies. This derivation extends earlier results for systems of interconnected rigid bodies only, and is much simpler than several other recent works on terminal flexible bodies. The model for a flexible body assumes that the elastic deformation is representable as a time-varying linear combination of given mode shapes.The paper also derives the appropriate form for gravitational terms, so that the equations can be used for flexible satellites. Also included are expressions for kinetic energy and angular momentum so that in case these are theoretically constant, they can be used to monitor the accuracy of the numerical integration. The paper concludes with a section showing how interbody constraint forces and torques (which do not appear in the equations of motion) can be recovered from quantities available in this formulation, and also how to treat state variables which are prescribed functions of time.A digital computer program based on the equations derived here has been used to simulate a spinning Skylab (with flexible booms) and also the interplanetary Viking (with flexible solar panels and thrust vector control).},

However, it is inconvenient for purposes of adaptive control due to its nonlinear dependence on the control input, even by using the neural network method. In this paper, we introduce a so called model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method, which is based on some new dynamical linearization model and concept, the partial form linearization (PFL) and the pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) of a SISO nonlinear discrete-time system. The model-free means that the controller design is only based on the I/O data of the controlled plant, no training process, no structure information and no model are needed. Rigorous analysis and extensive simulations have shown that it has BIBO stability and performs very well.

We first discuss the new MFBS technique, which does not rely on the detailed model of the system, and makes use of only the system structure and measurements of the state. The MFBS technique makes use of a normal form of the system model and estimates the unknown dynamics. An approach is also proposed to deal with the unknown control coefficient. The equivalence of the control designed with the proposed method to the control designed with the knowledge of the control coefficient is established. The control designed with the proposed MFBS technique is compared with the LQR control in various settings. It is found that for the RIP control problem, the proposed control performs as good as, or better than the LQR control, but has an advantage of being model-free.},

Furthermore, the computation is complicated in that each particular column has to be dealt with in an individual way. In ordei to overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents an improved compartmental method, based on the introduction of two types of `standard' separation blocks. Separation functions of these blocks are derived, so that computation for columns with diversified structure can be carried out in a systematic manner. By varying block parameters and variables, any real column met in practice can be readily modelled by a suitable number of standard separation blocks. The results of a simulation sample made on a 100 tray, 16 component xylene column show that the above mentioned drawbacks are removed. The proposed model- ling method can be used for fast simulation and control of columns in industrial practice.},

Based on a single batch of input\textendash output data collected from the process, a fixed structure controller is estimated without using a process model, by embedding the control design problem in the prediction error identification of an optimal controller. This is an extension of optimal controller identification (OCI) for multivariable systems. Even though the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) formulation is extended from its single-input single-output version in a natural way, the solution of the optimization problem is rather complex due to the special structure the inverse of the controller assumes in its MIMO version. Comparisons between the OCI and the virtual reference feedback tuning\textemdash a well-known data-driven control method\textemdash are provided, showing the efficiency of the OCI controller estimate. We also explore the case where the batch of design data is collected in closed loop. Simulated and experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper suggests a model-free control approach for tuning nonlinear state feedback controllers to ensure model reference output tracking in an optimal control framework. An iterative Batch fitted Q (BFQ)-learning strategy uses two neural networks (NNs) to estimate the value function (critic) and the controller (actor). An initially stabilizing linear Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) controller learned from few input-output process samples is then used to collect significantly more input-state-output samples in a controlled constrained environment, by compensating for undesired process dynamics. This collected data is subsequently used to learn significantly superior nonlinear state feedback NN controllers for model reference output tracking using the proposed iterative BFQ-learning strategy. The mixed VRFT-BFQ learning approach is experimentally validated on the water level control of a multi input-multi output (MIMO) nonlinear constrained coupled two-tank system. Although the VRFT control is designed independently for each control channel and does not ensure decoupling, straightforward (MIMO) BFQ-learning proves good decoupling and ensures indirect linearization of the feedback MIMO control system.},

This paper presents a novel data-driven method for nonlinear control design based on the virtual-reference feedback tuning (VRFT) framework and block-oriented modeling of nonlinear systems. Control-design algorithms for Hammerstein, Wiener, and Hammerstein-Wiener systems were systematically developed. The proposed method can be applied to design a nonlinear controller for an unknown plant directly using one-shot input-output data generated by the plant. In the method, identifying a complete dynamic model of the nonlinear system is not necessary; and only the static non-linearity (or its inverse), represented by the B-spline series, requires estimation. Moreover, in the method, the non-linearity estimation and control design processes are performed simultaneously without the need for nonlinear optimization or iterative procedures. The effectiveness of the proposed control design method is demonstrated herein through several simulation examples, including two benchmark processes (namely, a distillation column and a pH-neutralization process).},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the Bayesian methods of comparing different types of dynamical structures for representing the given set of observations. Specifically, given that a given processy(\textbackslash cdot)obeys one ofrdistinct stochastic or deterministic difference equations each involving a vector of unknown parameters, we compute the posterior probability that a set of observationsy(1),...,y(N)obeys theith equation, after making suitable assumptions about the prior probability distribution of the parameters in each equation. The difference equations can be nonlinear in the variableybut should be linear in the parameter vector in it. Once the posterior probability is known, we can find a decision rule to choose between the various structures so as to minimize the average value of a loss function. The optimum decision rule is asymptotically consistent and gives a quantitative explanation for the "principle of parsimony" often used in the construction of models from empirical data. The decision rule answers a wide variety of questions such as the advisability of a nonlinear transformation of data, the limitations of a model which yields a perfect fit to the data (i.e., zero residual variance), etc. The method can be used not only to compare different types of structures but also to determine a reliable estimate of spectral density of process. We compare the method in detail with the hypothesis testing method, and other methods and give a number of illustrative examples.},

We briefly discuss the major issues encountered dur- ing the design and construction of the simulator (such as sensor output filtering, motor parameters identification, etc) and the approaches developed to remedy these difficul- ties. To achieve a virtually torque-free environment it is necessary to carefully balance the spacecraft platform.We describe the method used to identify the moment of inertia of the platform and the center of gravity.

  abstract = {In this paper, the technique of local linear dynamics assignment is presented, which complements the powerful Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) methodology. In IDA-PBC, nonlinear state feedback controllers are designed by matching the system's dynamics with a desired Port-Hamiltonian (PH) state representation. The latter consists of an energy function, which serves as the closed-loop Lyapunov function, as well as matrices, describing the virtual internal exchange and dissipation of the energy. A major difficulty in IDA-PBC is how to determine reasonable values for the large number of free design parameters. Local linear dynamics assignment offers a solution to this problem with a number of advantages. (i) Invoking the closed-loop Jacobian linearization to fix the parameter values provides transparency with respect to the resulting local dynamic behavior. (ii) An appropriate state transformation isolates the coordinates available for energy shaping. (iii) A related local linear state transformation makes the resulting system of design equations linear. (iv) Assigning a Hurwitz closed-loop Jacobian and ensuring positive semi-definiteness of the closed-loop dissipation matrix, the tedious definiteness check of the energy is omitted. The design steps are illustrated with the Ball on Wheel example. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One of the major concerns of this text is to present design methods, employing modern techniques, for obtaining control systems that stand up to the requirements that have been so well developed in the classical expositions of control theory. Therefore, among other things, an entire chapter is devoted to a description of the analysis of control systems, mostly following the classical lines of thought. In the later chapters of the book, in which modern synthesis methods are developed, the chapter on analysis is recurrently referred to. Furthermore, special attention is paid to subjects that are standard in classical control theory but are frequently overlooked in modern treatments, such as nonzero set point control systems, tracking systems, and control systems that have to cope with constant disturbances. Also, heavy emphasis is placed upon the stochastic nature of control problems because the stochastic aspects are so essential."--Preface.

Its peculiarity with respect to the mainstream literature is to be especially conceived for obtaining models that are structurally simple, easy to estimate and well suited for model-based control. This goal is pursued by adopting linear-in-the-parameters NARX models, for which an identification method is developed based on the minimization of the simulation error. This method is capable of selecting the model structure together with the parameters, thus it does not require a priori structural information. A set of validation tests is reported, with the aim of demonstrating the technique's efficiency by comparing it to a widely accepted MRD modelling approach.},

Adaptive control [1], [2] and optimal control [3] represent different philosophies for designing feedback controllers. Optimal controllers are normally designed of ine by solving Hamilton JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, for example, the Riccati equation, using complete knowledge of the system dynamics. Determining optimal control policies for nonlinear systems requires the offline solution of nonlinear HJB equations, which are often difficult or impossible to solve. By contrast, adaptive controllers learn online to control unknown systems using data measured in real time along the system trajectories. Adaptive controllers are not usually designed to be optimal in the sense of minimizing user-prescribed performance functions. Indirect adaptive controllers use system identification techniques to first identify the system parameters and then use the obtained model to solve optimal design equations [1]. Adaptive controllers may satisfy certain inverse optimality conditions [4].},

  abstract = {Along with the fast development of ultra-precision motion systems, model and control of piezoelectric actuators draw significant research interest. Unfortunately, one of the main obstacles hindering their applications is the hysteresis, which is not ignorable in applications that require a high accuracy in motion control. In this paper, a new NARMAX model based on BP neural network is proposed for modeling the nonlinear hysteresis behavior in piezoelectric actuator. Because the proposed model is constructed in an online way, there is no need to conduct experiments for parameters identification. In order to demonstrate the precision and the rate-dependent property of the proposed model, experiments are performed under designed excitations with different amplitudes and frequencies. Furthermore, taking advantage of the proposed model, we design a nonlinear controller based on adaptive inverse control for the compensation of hysteresis in the piezoelectric actuator. A feature of the developed controller is that it allows piezoelectric actuator which exhibits complex nonlinear hysteresis behavior to be directly controlled without dynamics modeling. Thus the developed controller can be generally used for various piezoelectric actuators with different dynamics, leading to favorable convenience in industrial applications. Because of essentially open-loop characteristics of the proposed control system, the instable phenomenon aroused by feedback can be avoided. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the developed control system. It is shown that the developed controller not only compensates the hysteresis in the piezoelectric actuator effectively, but also exhibits rate-dependent property that allows piezoelectric actuator to track both periodic and non-periodic motions accurately. \textcopyright{} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Due to the under-actuated property of quadrotor helicopter, the controller can set the helicopter track three Cartesian positions (x, y, z) and the yaw angle to their desired values and stabilize the pitch and roll angles. The system has been presented into three interconnected subsystems. The first one representing the under-actuated subsystem, gives the dynamic relation of the horizontal positions (x, y) with the pitch and roll angles. The second fully-actuated subsystem gives the dynamics of the vertical position z and the yaw angle. The last subsystem gives the dynamics of the propeller forces. A backstepping control is presented to stabilize the whole system. The design methodology is based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Various simulations of the model show that the control law stabilizes a quadrotor with good tracking. \textcopyright{} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This article describes the project of a device for attitude determination, developed to be applied on small satellites, and other applications that can be adapted to the device. The proposed approach is based on the measurement of the Earth magnetic field and the Sun directions, and it requires the complete domain of space orientation estimation, that must be provided adequately to the attitude control system.. The device architecture is composed by functional modules, e.g. magnetic field sensor, signal pre-processing, A/D converters, processor, memory, serial and parallel ports. The main objective is the construction of a prototype with low cost, reduced dimensions, and low energy requirements. The magnetic field sensor is the solid state magnetometer HMC2003 (Honeywell), and the processor is a microcontroller of the 8051 family. The experimental tests and the development of the methodology use initially the LabView software platform for the algorithm computations, and a Helmholtz coil for the magnetic field generation. The adopted algorithm for the satellite attitude estimation is based on an optimization method and the attitude representation is given using quaternions. The paper concludes with the description of the project stages, like the fault tolerance tools and the implementation os the experimental Sun sensor.},

It develops MERR, a multiobjective extension of a methodology well-known as the error reduction ratio (ERR). It is shown that it is possible to choose terms which take into account dynamics of prediction error and other types of affine information, such as fixed points or static curve. Two examples are included to illustrate the proposed methodology. A numerical example shows that the technique is able to reconstruct the structure of a system, known a priori. The identification of a pilot DC\textendash DC buck converter shows that the proposed approach is capable to find models valid over a wide range of operation points. In this latter example, MERR is compared with ERR in two forms: (i) affine information is applied only in the structure selection for MERR and (ii) affine information is applied for structure selection for MERR and for parameter estimation for both MERR and ERR. In both comparisons, MERR presented nondominated solutions of Pareto set.},

Meanwhile, in Brazil the utilization of induction generators working with PAT\'is still stand in laboratory scope and experiments, as in the Hydromechanics Laboratory for Small Hydropower Plants \~n LHPCH \~n UNIFEI, (VIANA, 1987) and (NOGUEIRA, 1990). This work, based on experimental results carried on the LHPCH, describe and recommend the utilization of induction motors working as generators (inductions generators) and operating with PAT\'is in the electric generating in isolatedsystems. Tests were realized, on a pump and a motor in the Label Laboratory of Pumps \~n LEB in UNIFEI, to built a curve that describes their behavior on water pumping. Tests in the PAT\'is and the induction generator were also realized to assemble the operational characteristics in the electric generating. Experimental matching were obtained between pump\'is and PAT\'is head and flow, as shown in the induction generator\'is and PAT\'is tecnical feasibility. Moreover this paper demonstrate the financial attractiveness in micro hydropower plants, as presented in the example of Boa Esperan\'Aa MHP, located in Delfim Moreira, Minas Gerais.

  abstract = {Externally applied voltages can create transient, non-selective pores in a cell's membrane, a phenomenon known as electroporation. Electroporation has reduced toxicity, is easy to perform, and does not induce the immune system. Therefore, the technique has a wide range of biological and medical applications. Previous experiments show that a two-pulse protocol, which consists of a fast, large-magnitude pulse and a slow, small-magnitude pulse, can increase the efficiency of drug delivery such as gene electrotransfer. In this work, we investigate the dynamics and control of the two-pulse protocol using a macroscopic model of electroporation. Numerical simulations show that there exists a range of pore radii that cannot be sustained using the conventional, open-loop, two-pulse protocol. As a result, one may need to use pores that are significantly larger than the sizes of the targeted molecules. Moreover, it is not possible to know the rate of delivery a priori. To ensure accurate drug delivery and avoid potential damage to the cell's membrane, we explore feedback mechanisms to eliminate the gap in sustainable pore radii and thus to precisely control the electroporation process. Numerical simulations show that a straightforward feedback algorithm can achieve robust control effects. Moreover, the control algorithm is effective without knowledge of the model and thus has the potential to be implemented in experiments.},

Considering a Set Membership (SM) setting, we provide two main contributions. The first one is a theoretical framework for the stability analysis of nonlinear feedback control systems, in which the controller {\^f} is an approximation identified from data of an ideal inverse model f o. In this framework, we derive sufficient conditions under which {\^f} stabilizes the closed-loop system. The second contribution is a technique for the direct design of an approximate controller f* from data, having suitable optimality and sparsity properties. In particular, we show that f* is an almost-optimal controller (in a worst-case sense), and we derive a guaranteed accuracy bound, which can be used to quantify the performance level of the DFK control system. The technique is based on convex optimization and sparse identification methods, and thus avoids the problem of local minima and allows an efficient on-line controller implementation in real-world applications. \textcopyright{} 2012 IEEE.},

The first one is a theoretical framework for the stability analysis of nonlinear feedback control systems, in which the controller (f) over cap is an approximation identified from data of an ideal inverse model f(0). In this framework, we derive sufficient conditions under which (f) over cap stabilizes the closed-loop system. The second contribution is a technique for the direct design of an approximate controller f\{*\} from data, having suitable optimality, stability, and sparsity properties. In particular, we show that f\{*\} is an almost-optimal controller (in a worst-case sense), and we derive a guaranteed accuracy bound, which can be used to quantify the performance level of the DFK control system. We also show that, when the number of data used for control design tends to infinity and these data are dense in the controller domain, the closed-loop stability is guaranteed for a set of trajectories of interest. The technique is based on convex optimization and sparse identification methods, and thus avoids the problem of local minima and allows an efficient online controller implementation in real-world applications. The third contribution is a simulation study, regarding the application of DFK to the challenging problem of control design for a class of airborne wind energy generators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we consider rate-independent and rate-dependent semilinear Duhem models with provable properties. The vector field is given by the product of a function of the input rate and linear dynamics. If the input rate function is positively homogeneous, then the resulting input-output map of the model is rate independent, yielding persistent nontrivial input-output closed curve (that is, hysteresis) at arbitrarily low input frequency. If the input rate function is not positively homogeneous, the input-output map is rate dependent and can be approximated by a rate-independent model for low frequency inputs. Sufficient conditions for convergence to a limiting input-output map are developed for rate-independent and rate-dependent models. Finally, the reversal behavior and orientation of the rate-independent model are discussed.},

  abstract = {Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized "shaping" only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL-PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models. \textcopyright{} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The theoretical developments include some variations and shortcuts that are useful when dealing with particular classes of systems, and the incorporation of additional features to handle control scenarios other than just stabilization. On the application side the method has provided solutions to a wide variety of physical problems. The purpose of this paper is to review the fundamental theory, main new results and practical applications of this control system design approach as well as to discuss the current open problems and future directions. \textcopyright{} 2004 EUCA.},

  abstract = {In this paper, previous works on nonlinear H{$\omega$} control for robot manipulators are extended. In particular, integral terms are considered to cope with persistent disturbances, such as constant load at the end-effector. The extended controller may be understood as a computed-torque control with an external PID, whose gain matrices vary with the position and velocity of the robot joints. In addition, in order to increase the controller robustness, an extension of the algorithms with saturation functions has been carried out. This extension deals with the resulting nonlinear equation of the closed-loop error. A modified expression for the required increment in the control signal is provided, and the local closed-loop stability of this approach is discussed. Finally, simulation results for a two-link robot and experimental results for an industrial robot are presented. The results obtained with this technique have been compared with those attained with the original controllers to show the improvements achieved by means of the proposed method. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Dynamical test benches are typically used in the development phase of engine systems and require tracking controllers with a high performance. Unfortunately, during such a work the components or operation parameters of the engine system are changed very frequently, making the use of classical model based control approaches very time-consuming. Against this background, this paper proposes a direct data-driven design approach for multivariable control of rotational speed and shaft torque of an internal combustion engine at a test bench based on an extended version of a recently introduced method for non-iterative direct data-driven tuning of multivariable controllers. This extension allows employing data collected in a closed-loop experiment in the direct identification of the controller parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on a test bench equipped with a production light duty Diesel engine. A comparison with the industrial state-of-the-art controller is provided on both a dynamically challenging test and a typical driving cycle as measured on an instrumented vehicle with the same internal combustion engine. The results confirm that the new method recovers the performance of the well-tuned industrial control, but can be developed in a fraction of the time as no explicit model of the system is needed. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, it is highly desirable to characterize the behaviors of nonlinearities and friction in the servo systems. This paper presents a fairly comprehensive modeling and compensation of friction and nonlinearities of a typical voice-coil-motor (VCM) actuator used in commercial HDDs, and the design of an HDD servo system using an enhanced nonlinear control technique. Our contributions are two-fold: We will first obtain a complete model of the VCM actuator including friction and nonlinear characteristics through a careful examination of the configuration and structure of the actual system and through a thorough analysis of its physical effects together with its time-domain and frequency-domain responses. We will then proceed to design a servo system for the hard drive using an enhanced composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control technique with a simple friction and nonlinearity compensation scheme. The enhanced CNF technique has a feature of removing the uncompensated portion of friction and nonlinearities without sacrificing the overall tracking performance. Simulation and experimental results for both the modeling and the servo design show that our approach is very effective and successful. In particular, our experimental results show that the enhanced CNF control has outperformed the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control in settling time by 76\%. We believe that this approach can be adopted to solve other servomechanism problems.},

Deriving such a model poses issues of parameterization, estimation, and validation of the model before designing the controller. In this paper, a direct data-driven control method is proposed for designing controllers that can handle constraints without deriving a model of the plant and directly from data. A hierarchical control architecture is used, in which an inner linear time-invariant or linear parameter-varying controller is first designed to match a simple and a priori specified closed-loop model. Then, an outer model predictive controller is synthesized to handle input/output constraints and to enhance the performance of the inner loop. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of a simulation and an experimental example. Practical implementation issues are also discussed.},

We consider systems affected by random bounded nonlinear uncertainty so that classical optimization methods based on linear matrix inequalities cannot be used without conservatism. The approach followed here is a blend of randomization techniques for the uncertainty together with convex optimization for the controller parameters. In particular, we propose an iterative algorithm for designing a controller which is based upon subgradient iterations. At each step of the sequence, we first generate a random sample and then we perform a subgradient step for a convex constraint defined by the LQR problem. The main result of the paper is to prove that this iterative algorithm provides a controller which quadratically stabilizes the uncertain system with probability one in a finite number of steps. In addition, at a fixed step, we compute a lower bound of the probability that a quadratically stabilizing controller is found.},

It is employed to develop, improve, and carry out objective tests of sensors, actuators, and algorithms in the experimental framework. Different sensors (i.e. sun, earth, magnetometer, and an inertial measurement unit) are utilized to assess three-axis deviations. A set of three inertial wheels is used as primary actuators for attitude control, together with three mutually perpendicular magnetic coils intended for desaturation purposes, and as a backup control system. Accurate balancing, through the platform's center of mass relocation into the geometrical center of the spherical air-bearing, significatively reduces gravitational torques, generating a virtually torque-free environment. A very practical balancing procedure was developed for equilibrating the table in the local horizontal plane, with a reduced final residual torque. A wireless monitoring system was developed for on-line and post-processing analysis; attitude data are displayed and stored, allowing properly evaluate the sensors, actuators, and algorithms. A specifically designed onboard computer and a set of microcontrollers are used to carry out attitude determination and control tasks in a distributed control scheme.

The novel iterative Batch Fitted Q-learning strategy uses two neural networks to represent the value function (critic) and the controller (actor), and it is referred to as a mixed Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Batch Fitted Q-learning approach. Learning convergence of the Q-learning schemes generally depends, among other settings, on the efficient exploration of the state-action space. Handcrafting test signals for efficient exploration is difficult even for input-output stable unknown processes. Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning can ensure an initial stabilizing controller to be learned from few input-output data and it can be next used to collect substantially more input-state data in a controlled mode, in a constrained environment, by compensating the process dynamics. This data is used to learn significantly superior nonlinear state feedback neural networks controllers for model reference tracking, using the proposed Batch Fitted Q-learning iterative tuning strategy, motivating the original combination of the two techniques. The mixed Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Batch Fitted Q-learning approach is experimentally validated for water level control of a multi input-multi output nonlinear constrained coupled two-tank system.

  abstract = {This paper proposes the design and implementation of a model-free tire slip control for a fast and highly nonlinear Anti-lock Braking System (ABS). A reinforcement Q-learning optimal control approach is inserted in a batch neural fitted scheme using two neural networks to approximate the value function and the controller, respectively. The transition samples required for learning high performance control can be collected by interacting with the process either by online exploiting the current iteration controller (or policy) under an {$\epsilon$}-greedy exploration strategy, or by using data collected under any other controller that is capable of ensuring efficient exploration of the action-state space. Both approaches are highlighted in the paper. Fortunately, the ABS process fits this type of learning-by-interaction because it does not need an initial stabilizing controller. The validation case studies conducted on a real laboratory setup reveal that high control system performance can be achieved using the proposed approaches. Insightful comments on the observed control behavior are offered along with performance comparisons with several types of model-based and model-free controllers including relay, model-based optimal PI, an original model-free neural network state-feedback VRFT controller and a model-free neural network adaptive actor-critic one. With the ability to improve control performance starting from different supervisory controllers or to learn high performance controllers from scratch, the proposed Q-learning optimal control approach proves its performance in a wide operating range and is therefore recommended to its industrial application on ABS.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a combined Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning\textendash Q-learning model-free control approach, which tunes nonlinear static state feedback controllers to achieve output model reference tracking in an optimal control framework. The novel iterative Batch Fitted Q-learning strategy uses two neural networks to represent the value function (critic) and the controller (actor), and it is referred to as a mixed Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning\textendash Batch Fitted Q-learning approach. Learning convergence of the Q-learning schemes generally depends, among other settings, on the efficient exploration of the state-action space. Handcrafting test signals for efficient exploration is difficult even for input-output stable unknown processes. Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning can ensure an initial stabilizing controller to be learned from few input-output data and it can be next used to collect substantially more input-state data in a controlled mode, in a constrained environment, by compensating the process dynamics. This data is used to learn significantly superior nonlinear state feedback neural networks controllers for model reference tracking, using the proposed Batch Fitted Q-learning iterative tuning strategy, motivating the original combination of the two techniques. The mixed Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning\textendash Batch Fitted Q-learning approach is experimentally validated for water level control of a multi input-multi output nonlinear constrained coupled two-tank system. Discussions on the observed control behavior are offered.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear H{$\infty$} controller is designed and applied for two-wheeled self-balanced vehicles, which are underactuated mechanical systems with input coupling. The main objective is, in the presence of exogenous disturbances, to ensure that the inclination angle of the pendulum (controlled DOF) is led to the upper vertical position, while the angular velocity of the wheels (the time-derivative of the remaining DOF) can be set in a desired reference value. Thus, the angular position of the wheels (remaining DOF) is driven to steady state, i.e., it is maintained stabilized (static equilibrium) ({$\phi$}\textperiodcentered =0rad/s), or at least its velocity (mechanical equilibrium) ({$\phi$}\textperiodcentered =const.rad/s). The proposed controller considers the whole dynamics of the system into its structure, ensuring that the overall system is closed-loop stable. Furthermore, an improvement of the nonlinear H{$\infty$} control tuning method for mechanical systems is developed. Experimental results are carried out with a real two-wheeled vehicle in the presence of external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and from extreme initial conditions.},

It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

  abstract = {This document presents the background, implementation and results for regressor selection in the nonlinear model context. The classical model structure selection techniques are introduced and serve as a motivation to develop model structure selection methods capable of dealing with nonlinear models in a randomized Monte Carlo fashion. A randomized approach for regressor selection was implemented in the context of nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX) model class as the extension of the RaMSS - Randomized Model Structure Selection method. The proposed method is compared to classical regressor techniques such as the ERR - Error Reduction Ratio - in both simulated and real data. Although the models selected by the proposed method are not always the more compact ones, they typically exhibit better performance in comparison to the models obtained by other methods. This is due to either better regressor selection performed by the algorithm or by the inclusion of NMA - Nonlinear Moving Average - what provides a more flexible system representation.},

  abstract = {Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is a method that has been developed to (asymptotically) stabilize nonlinear systems formulated in the port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) structure. This method has gained increasing popularity and has been successfully applied to a wide range of dynamical systems. However, little is known about the robustness of this method in response to the effects of uncertainty which could result from disturbances, noises, and modeling errors. This paper explores the possibility of extending some energy shaping methods, taking into account the robustness aspects, with the aim of maintaining (asymptotic) stability of the system in the presence of perturbations which inevitably exist in any realistic applications. We propose constructive results on robust IDA-PBC controllers for underactuated mechanical systems that are quite commonly found in practice and have the most challenging control problems within this context. The proposed results extend some existing methods and provide a new framework that allows the implementation of integral and input-to-state stability controllers to underactuated mechanical systems. The results are applied to two physical systems: an inertia wheel pendulum and a rotary inverted pendulum that represent separable and nonseparable PCH systems, respectively.},

Air bearings have been used for satellite attitude determination and control hardware verification and software development for nearly 45 years. It is interesting to consider the history of this technology: how early systems were first devised and what diverse capabilities current systems provide. First a survey is given of planar systems that give a payload freedom to translate and spin. Then several classes of rotational air bearings are discussed: those which simulate three-axis satellite attitude dynamics. The subsequent section discusses perhaps the most interesting facilities: those that provide both translational and three-dimensional rotational freedom. The diverse capabilities each style of air-bearing testbed provides, the many settings they can be found in, and ways to improve facility performance are described.},

  abstract = {The most critical step in modern direct datadriven control design approaches, such as virtual reference feedback tuning and non-iterative correlation-based tuning, is the choice of an adequate closed-loop reference model. Indeed, the chosen reference model should reflect the desired closedloop performance but also be reproducible by the underlying unknown process when in closed loop with the synthesized controller. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute, directly from data, an ``optimal'' reference model along with the corresponding controller. The performance index used to define the optimality of the reference model measures the tracking error and the actuator efforts (as it is typical in performancedriven controllers such as linear-quadratic Gaussian control and model predictive control), along with a term penalizing the expected mismatch between the reference model and the actual closed-loop system. The performance index depends on the variables used to parametrize the reference model and the controller, which are optimized through a suitable combination of particle swarm optimization and virtual reference feedback tuning.},

  abstract = {Control of super-articulated mechanical systems (SAMS: controlled mechanical system in which the dimension of the configuration space exceeds the dimension of the control input space) is studied. As a starting point, a graphical characterization of general SAMS is developed in which a so-called control flow diagram (CFD) is constructed to represent the interaction forces among the degrees of freedom of the system; three types of structure, namely, the chain structure, the tree structure and isolated points, are identified; degree of complexity of the system is defined based on the structure of the system. A systematic backstepping type controller design is proposed for systems with a chain structure to achieve global asymptotic stability and trajectory tracking. Such a controller design itself illustrates the sufficient conditions for the existence of smooth feedback control such that the systems with a chain structure can be globally asymptotically stabilized. The connection of our control algorithm with existing results is discussed. \textcopyright{} 1994 IEEE},

In this paper, we discuss this issue in the control of multiple-input multiple-output plants in the very typical case where a no plant model is available and the controller structure is defined a priori. Experimental results in a three-tank level control plant show how a naive choice of the reference model leads to very poor closed-loop performance. The problem is then analyzed, exposing the naivete of this design example and deriving the general guidelines for the effective choice of the reference model in multivariable systems. The application of these guidelines to the three-tank plant illustrates their effectiveness.},

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

Our upper bound relies on a generalization of Mendelson's small-ball method to dependent data, eschewing the use of standard mixing-time arguments. Our lower bounds reveal that these upper bounds match up to logarithmic factors. In particular, we capture the correct signal-to-noise behavior of the problem, showing that more unstable linear systems are easier to estimate. This behavior is qualitatively different from arguments which rely on mixing-time calculations that suggest that unstable systems are more difficult to estimate. We generalize our technique to provide bounds for a more general class of linear response time-series.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the classical Preisach hysteresis modeling and tracking control of a curved pre-stressed piezoceramic patch actuator system with severe hysteresis. The actuator is also flexible with very small inherent damping. It has potential applications in active antennas. A series of tests are conducted to study the hysteresis properties of the piezoceramic actuator system. The numerical expressions of the classical Preisach model for different input variations are presented. The classical Preisach model is applied to simulate the static hysteresis behavior of the system. Higher order hysteresis reversal curves predicted by the classical Preisach model are verified experimentally. The good agreement found between the measured and predicted curves showed that the classical Preisach model is an effective mean for modeling the hysteresis of the piezoceramic actuator system. Subsequently, the inverse classical Preisach model is established and applied to cancel the hysteresis the piezoceramic actuator system for the real-time microposition tracking control. In order to improve the control accuracy and to increase damping of the actuator system, a cascaded PD/lead-lag feedback controller is designed with consideration of the dynamics of the actuator. In the experiments, two cases are considered, control with major loop hysteresis compensation, and control with minor loop hysteresis compensation. Experimental results show that RMS tracking errors are reduced by 50\% to 70\% if the hysteresis compensation is added in the feedforward path in both cases. Therefore, hysteresis compensation with the feedback controller greatly improves the tracking control accuracy of the piezoceramic actuator.},

Magnetorheological (MR) dampers are semiactive control devices that use MR fluids to produce controllable dampers. They potentially offer highly reliable operation and can be viewed as fail-safe in that they become passive dampers should the control hardware malfunction. To develop control algorithms that take full advantage of the unique features of the MR damper, models must be developed that can adequately characterize the damper's intrinsic nonlinear behavior. Following a review of several idealized mechanical models for controllable fluid dampers, a new model is proposed that can effectively portray the behavior of a typical MR damper. Comparison with experimental results for a prototype damper indicates that the model is accurate over a wide range of operating conditions and is adequate for control design and analysis.},

Properties of this solution are examined for both minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase systems. This leads to a formal weight augmentation procedure for the minimum-phase case which permits essentially arbitrary specification of system sensitivity functions in terms of the weights. While such arbitrary specifications are not possible for nonminimum-phase problems, a direct relationship between weights and sensitivities is developed for nonminimum-phase SISO and certain nonminimum-phase MIMO cases which guides the weight selection process.},

Although such temporal-difference method\textasciitilde{} have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, telnporal-differenee methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporaldifference methods can be applied to advantage.},

The nonlinear auto-regressive and moving average model with exogenous input (NARMAX) is utilized to describe the behavior of DSSH based on the input space expansion. Since the input-output characteristic of DSSH is usually a distorted dynamic hysteresis, a hysteretic operator is developed to act as a coordinate to specify the change tendency of the distorted dynamic hysteresis so as to transform its multi-valued mapping into a one-to-one mapping without dependence on the gradient of the output of DSSH with respect to its input, as the non-differentiable feature of the distorted dynamic hysteresis can not ensure the gradients of the extrema to be obtained. Both the modified akaike's information criterion (MAIC) and the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm are employed to estimate appropriate structure and parameters of the model in the range of the assumed model structure. The simulations and experiment on X-Y ultra-precision micro-moving stage (UPMMS) are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. \textcopyright{} 2013 IMACS.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It has been found that the response of acupuncture point on the human meridian line exhibits nonlinear dynamic behavior when excitation of electroacupuncture is implemented on another meridian point. This nonlinear phenomenon is in fact a hysteretic phenomenon. In order to explore the characteristic of human meridian and finally find a way to improve the treatment of diseases via electro-acupuncture method, it is necessary to identify the model to describe the corresponding dynamic hysteretic phenomenon of human meridian systems stimulated by electric-acupuncture. In this paper, an identification method using nonlinear autoregressive and moving average model with exogenous input (NARMAX) is proposed to model the dynamic hysteresis in human meridian. As the hysteresis is a nonlinear system with multivalued mapping, the traditional NARMAX model is unavailable to it directly. Thus, an expanded input space is constructed to transform the multi-valued mapping of the hysteresis to a one-to-one mapping. Then, the identification method using NARMAX model on the constructed expanded input space is developed. Finally, the proposed method is applied to hysteresis modeling for human meridian systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the paper the static input nonlinearity is transformed into a polytopic description. The remaining uncertain linear model is used in a MPC algorithm of which the optimization problem involves minimization of a linear objective function subject to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which is a convex problem. A procedure is presented to remove a number of LMIs from the optimization problem, prior to solving it. By means of an iterative procedure the conservatism of the polytopic description can be reduced. Nominal closed loop stability of this Hammerstein MPC algorithm is guaranteed.

  abstract = {This report presents the modeling results for three systems, two numerical and one experimental. In the numerical examples, we use mathematical models previously obtained in the literature as the systems to be identified. The first numerical example is a heating system with a polynomial nonlinearity that is described by a Hammerstein model. The second is a Bouc-Wen model that represents the hysteretic behavior in a piezoelectric actuator. Finally, the experimental example is a pneumatic valve that presents a variety of nonlinearities, including hysteresis. For each example, a Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX) is identified using two well-established techniques together, the Error Reduction Ratio (ERR) method to hierarchically select the regressors and the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to truncate the number of terms. Using both approaches, the structure selection is achieved. The design of the excitation input is based on preserving the frequencies of interest and force the system to achieve different points of operation. Hence, having the structure previously selected with ERR and AIC, we use the Extended Least Squares (ELS) algorithm to estimate the parameters. The results show that it is possible to identify the referred systems with no more than five terms. These identified models will be used for nonlinearity compensation in future works.},

  title = {Robust Control Strategies for a {{QuadRotor}} Helicopter},
  author = {Vianna Raffo, Guilherme},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {This thesis deals with robust control strategies to solve the path tracking problemfor an autonomous aerial vehicle. The UAV considered is aQuadRotorhelicopteron a small scale, which is characterized by an underactuated mechanical system,i.e., they have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom.Normally, to design advanced control strategies an accuracy dynamic mo-del of the system is necessary. Thus, in this thesis a proper dynamic model oftheQuadRotorhelicopter for control design purposes is formulated, keeping inmind a tradeoff between complexity and realism. The system is based on physicallaws to obtain a model that represents the vehicle behavior in presence of severalsources of uncertainties and to be suitable to the prototype used in this work.Since theQuadRotorhelicopter is an underactuated mechanical system, acommon way to perform path tracking of UAV's is using cascade control strategies.Therefore, cascade structures are proposed to control two subsystems: the rota-tional one and the translational one. For the rotational subsystem a nonlinear statefeedbackH{$\infty$}controller designed for mechanical systems is used, which provides robustness in presence of exogenous disturbances, parametric uncertainties andunmodeled dynamics. To perform the path tracking for theQuadRotorhelicopterthree control techniques are used looking for a continuous performance improve-ment. First a linear state feedbackH{$\infty$}control law is applied assuring robustnessproperties. To enhance the guidance of the vehicle, an integral predictive con-troller based on the translational error model is designed given smoothness to thepath tracking. After that, to enlarge the workspace of the translational motion, acontrol law based on an integral backstepping approach is performed using thenonlinear model of the helicopter.Taking into account the underactuated configuration of theQuadRotorheli-copter, two nonlinearH{$\infty$}control strategies are proposed. First a control law isdesigned considering only a reduced system where is composed by the controlleddegrees of freedom. This controller is applied to the helicopter in cascade with theprevious predictive controller, where the nonlinearH{$\infty$}controller is in a charge ofthe altitude and attitude motions, while the MPC controls the lateral and longit-udinal movements. Other applications are also carried out using this controller,which are based on the inverted pendulum concept.The cascade control strategies have an inconvenient. Although in the sim-ulation results the whole closed loop presents a stable behavior, it is needed tobe demonstrated. To avoid using cascade structures, a control strategy based onthe nonlinearH{$\infty$}technique applied to underactuated mechanical systems is per-formed. The goal is to obtain a control law that guarantees robustness for thepath tracking problem of theQuadRotorhelicopter without the necessity of cas-cade strategies nor state space augmentation. Additionally, an approach of thenonlinearH{$\infty$}controller for mechanical systems is presented allowing to weightdifferent dynamics of the system.Another issue tackled is the robustness improvement of the nonlinearH{$\infty$}con-troller designed for mechanical systems. This control law is computed takinginto account that all uncertainties that affect the system are external disturbances.However, this hypothesis is not very realistic. Therefore, to counterattack thisproblem, a solution to robustify the nonlinearH{$\infty$}control law is given, where anadditional control signal is computed through the saturation function technique tocope with modeling errors.Summarizing, this thesis presents a theoretic development of robust controlstrategies to solve the path tracking problem for unmanned aerial vehicles, focus-ing on underactuated mechanical systems.},

The control measurements are those indicating the state of the plant and environment. The learning is accomplished by reinforcement of the probability of choosing a particular control choice for a given control situation.

  abstract = {In this paper, the robust optimal control of continuous-time affine nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties is investigated by using a data-based integral policy iteration approach. It is a natural extension of the traditional optimal control design, under the framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method, to robust optimal control of nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties. In theoretical aspect, by increasing a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system, the robust controller of the matched uncertain system is obtained, which also achieves optimality with a newly well-defined cost function. When regarding the implementation, the data-based integral policy iteration algorithm is used to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system with completely unknown dynamics information. Then, the actor-critic technique based on neural networks and least squares implementation method are employed to facilitate deriving the optimal control law iteratively, so that the closed-form expression of the robust optimal controller is available. Additionally, two simulation examples with application backgrounds are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established robust optimal control scheme. In summary, it is important to note that the result developed in this paper broadens the application scope of ADP-based optimal control approach to more general nonlinear systems possessing dynamical uncertainties.},

Since NARX models can employ past values of time series as inputs, it is possible to estimate the property of hysteresis to Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). The innovation of this paper lies in the development of a creative Jordan-plus-Elman NARX recurrent neural network (Jordan-Elman network) model as well as its training procedure. In this paper, the proposed model is applied to an ultra-thin SMA wire with a diameter of 0.001. in., which can be actuated/heated by an electric current. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jordan-Elman network dramatically improves the modeling error (mean squared error) in comparison with a Jordan NARX neural network. In addition, with good generalization results, the proposed model successfully identifies and estimates the hysteretic behavior of the ultra-thin SMA wire including major loops and minor loops at various frequencies. \textcopyright{} 2014.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

For the existing NN consensus approaches, to obtain the desired approximation accuracy, the NN-based adaptive consensus algorithms require the number of NN nodes to must be large enough, and thus the online computation burden often are very heavy. However, the proposed adaptive consensus scheme can greatly reduce the online computation burden, because the adaptive adjusting parameters are designed in scalar form, which is the norm of the estimation of the optimal NN weight matrix. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed approach can guarantee the leader-following consensus behaviour of non-linear second-order multi-agent systems to be obtained. Finally, a numerical simulation and a multi-manipulator simulation are carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a control technique named optimized backstepping is first proposed by implementing tracking control for a class of strict-feedback systems, which considers optimization as a design philosophy of the high-order system control. The basic idea is that designing the actual and virtual controls of backstepping is the optimized solutions of the corresponding subsystems so that overall control of the high-order system is optimized. In general, optimization control is designed based on the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, but solving the equation is very difficult due to the inherent nonlinearity and intractability. In order to overcome the difficulty, the neural network (NN)-based reinforcement learning strategy of actor-critic architecture is used. In every backstepping step, the actor and critic NNs are constructed for executing control behavior and evaluating control performance, respectively. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proven that the desired control performance can be obtained. Finally, a simulation example is carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

Three 2-DOF parallel mechanism architectures dedicated to machining applications are studied in this paper. The three mechanisms have two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with different relative orientation. The comparative study is conducted on the basis of a same prescribed Cartesian workspace for the three mechanisms. The common desired workspace properties are a rectangular shape and given kinetostatic performances. The machine size of each resulting design is used as a comparative criterion. The 2-DOF machine mechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to 3-axis machines by adding a third joint.},

The two proposed control algorithms are only based on the PPD parameter estimation derived online from the I/O data of the controlled system, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to prove all signals of close-loop control system are bounded. A numerical example, a steam-water heat exchanger example and an experimental test show that the proposed control algorithm has a very reliable tracking ability and a satisfactory robustness to disturbances and process dynamics variations.},

Since a tradeoff should be made between manufacturing costs and static performance, two symmetry dead-zones are introduced in the main stage spring constant: the center dead-zone caused by the center floating position and the intermediate dead-zone caused by the intermediate position. Though the intermediate dead-zone is much smaller than the center dead-zone, it has significant effect on the dynamic position tracking performance. In this paper, the cascade dead-zones problem in a typical two-stage PDV is analyzed and a cascade dead-zones model is proposed for the main stage spring constant. Then, a cascade dead-zones inverse method is improved with gain estimation and dead-zone detection to compensate the dead-zone nonlinearity. Finally, a digital controller is designed for verification. The comparative experimental results indicate that it is effective to reduce the large position tracking error when the proposed method is applied.},

  abstract = {This brief presents a general methodology of controller design by the hybrid neuro-inverse control with knowledge-based nonlinear separation for industrial nonlinear systems. In industrial nonlinear systems, various kinds of uncertainties may cause serious deterioration of system performances. Unfortunately, these uncertainties are usually difficult to identify and compensate from the entire system point of view. With using the knowledge-based nonlinear separation, nonlinear dynamics of a nonlinear system is possibly separated into the input-output nonlinear static part and the nonlinear dynamic part to form a nonlinear separation structure. Hence, uncertainties in the nonlinear system are bounded in the nonlinear dynamic part. In the proposed hybrid neuro-inverse control method, the input-output nonlinear static part is controlled by an inverse controller. A neurocontroller with a rigidly defined and trained neural network using available prior knowledge of the nonlinear system is constructed for the control of the nonlinear dynamic part. Owing to using the knowledge-based nonlinear separation, the neurocontroller is only needed to control a part of the original nonlinear dynamics of industrial nonlinear systems contaminated by uncertainties. The structure of the neural network employed by the neurocontroller becomes simpler and the consumption of time in training is reduced. Meanwhile, system performances of the nonlinear system can be improved. In this brief, with two typical control problems in industries, i.e., high-precision contour control of industrial articulated robot arm (IARA) and outlet working fluid heat rate control of evaporator in energy conversion plant, the proposed method was explained clearly. The experimental and simulation results demonstrated the generality, practicality and significant potential of this method for realizing the high-performance control of industrial nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a solution to adaptive output-feedback control for a class of nonsmooth nonlinear systems. First, the concept of semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability that has been widely used for smooth nonlinear systems with lower triangular systems is extended to the nonsmooth systems. Then by resorting to set-valued maps and set-valued derivatives, a new Lyapunov criterion ensuring the SGUUB stability is developed for nonsmooth nonlinear systems, which establishes the theory foundation for the subsequent backstepping control design. With the help of Cellina approximate selection theorem and smooth approximation theorem for Lipschitz functions, the system under investigation is first transformed into an equivalent model. In the sequel, exploring some efficient techniques, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback controller is constructed for the systems under consideration by utilizing an appropriate observer and the approximation ability of fuzzy systems. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Hence, the problem of determining the structure of candidate controller is transformed to the problem of finding a sequence of local dynamic controllers to approximate the ideal controller. With the help of gradient information extracted from input and output (I/O) data of the plant, the optimal controller parameter sequence is generated by minimising a user-defined control criterion. This method gives a solution on how to determine the candidate controller structure. The controller design, parameter tuning and controller validation are based on I/O data of the plant.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by the simulation of a continuous polymerisation reaction process in a jacketed continuous stirred tank reactor system.

The starting point has been the IMC-PID tuning rules that have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The rule for the integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the ``half rule'' for obtaining the effective time delay.},
